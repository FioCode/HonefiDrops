The reports are published with a description of the work done, as well as technical details if the deliverables contain development of any functionality.

For convenient activity monitoring, we have made a navigation of all currently started and completed tasks, which is shown below.

## ðŸ“œ List of Deliverables

1. [Auction Platform]().
2. [LaunchPool Platform]().
3. [Backend Development]().
4. [Final Stage]().


###  Auction Platform

The Auction Platform is a tool for two types of auctions (balance and Dutch) that works with both NFTs and tokens. The development is divided into several stages:
- [x] Creating UI/UX in a modern style
- [x] Frontend development for NFT's auctions and tokens sections
- [x] Development of smart contracts for each type of auction (NFT and tokens)
- [x] Developing an auction dashboard

#### UI/UX

#### Frontend development for NFT's auctions and tokens sections

We have developed Frontend for all the necessary functionality related to creating and participating in auctions. You can use https://honefi.app to test the full functionality. The main tasks performed:
- Connecting authentication for WAX cloud wallet and anchor
- Auction creation page - https://honefi.app/create
- Current NFT auctions page (and filter) - https://honefi.app/drops
- Current Tokens auctions page (and filter) - https://honefi.app/tokens
- Auction pages containing purchase, settings, auction information and all social media

#### Development of smart contracts for each type of auction (NFT and tokens)

HoneFi Main Smart Contract - **honefidropsx

The source code of the smart contract is uploaded to this repository and can be viewed [here](links)

#### Developing an auction dashboard

To create auctions, we made a management page, which is available after connecting the wallet to the site - https://honefi.app/create

Creation takes place in several stages:
- Select the desired collection and add auth to the collection (approve)
- Go to collection management (the "Manage" button) and get available functions, which include - NFT drop page, Token drop page, top up RAM balance for the collection
- When you go to one of the drop management pages, you can either create a new dropbox or go to an existing one.
- To create a new drop, you need to fill in all the fields on the page - the name, description, price changes in % and minutes, add a cover and specify the start time of the auction, as well as its duration
- In the next step, you can check how your drop will look after creation. If everything is filled in correctly, you can create the drop
